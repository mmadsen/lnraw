I"¤<p>From Jill North: â€œThe â€˜Structureâ€™ of Physics: A Case Studyâ€ <span class="citation" data-cites="north2009structure">(North 2009)</span>.</p>
<p>North argues that despite the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian frameworks in classical mechanics giving identical equations of motion, they are different theories of the world that imply different â€œstructureâ€. In this case, structure means â€œconceptual machinery needed to describe the worldâ€. So thereâ€™s a sense in which â€œless structureâ€ implies a â€œmore fundamental theoryâ€ and a â€œsimplerâ€ account of the empirical phenomena. North convincingly argues that the Lagrangian formulation requires just a bit more â€œstructureâ€ mathematically than the Hamiltonian framework, and thus that the Hamiltonian framework is, in a sense, more fundamental since it has no â€œextra moving partsâ€ than those required to exactly describe the equations of motion.</p>
<p>This is a good thing to keep in mind â€“ how do we know we have a clean, minimal, classification or empirical model for a phenomenon? This is clearly an â€œOccamâ€™s razorâ€ idea for structure and theoretical description, but itâ€™s well done by North in the context. You might need a mathematical formalism with more-than-minimal structure in order to solve a practical problem, but the fundamental description will have only the minimal structure required.</p>
