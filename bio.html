<h2>About the Author</h2>

<p>Mark E. Madsen is an anthropologist, evolutionary biologist, technology entrepreneur, and software engineer living in the San Juan Islands of Washington State. </p>

<p>I'm currently completing my Ph.D. in anthropology at the University of Washington.  I began my doctorate under the mentorship of Robert C. Dunnell in 1988, while completing my master's degree at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  Dr. Dunnell sadly passed away in Dec 2010, and my committee now consists of Drs. James Feathers, Ben Marwick, Carl Bergstrom, and Carl Lipo. </p>

<p>Between 1995 and 2006, I worked in a variety of capacities in Seattle-based software and data networking companies. I was a founding or very early engineer at RealNetworks, Internap Network Services, and GridNetworks.  I co-founded AllRecipes.com (as Emergent Media, Inc) with Carl Lipo, Tim Hunt, Dan Shepherd, David Quinn, and Michael Pfeffer, and I co-founded Network Clarity with Christopher D. Wheeler.  I served in a variety of management, board, and engineering roles in these companies.  Most recently, I worked briefly at Microsoft in the Windows Enterprise Management Division, on new product initiatives and technology licensing and acquisitions.  </p>

<p>My research focuses on the ways Darwinian evolutionary theory needs to be expanded or modified to include culture and language as systems of heritable transmission. I worked briefly in the Ohio River valley, spent 5 years working with Robert Dunnell in the central Mississippi River valley, worked with Julie K. Stein in the San Juan Islands, and did a stint in Pakistan at Harappa with Mark Kenoyer and George Dales. I was a National Science Foundation Graduate Research fellow, and received my B.A. (cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa) from the Univ. of Washington in 1988 and my M.S. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1990.</p>

<p>I am currently immediate past President (and current VP) of the Board of Directors for Seattle Arts and Lectures, a board member of the San Juan County Economic Development Council, and a Trustee of the San Juan Island Library District (and past board President). I am also a past board member and Chairman of the San Juan Islands Agricultural Guild, and worked for several years to purchase the Brickworks site in Friday Harbor, leading to its successful acquisition in November 2010.
My partner Nicole lives in Seattle with her daughter, is a specialist in Emergency Medicine, and is co-founder and a managing partner in Eastside Emergency Physicians.</p>
