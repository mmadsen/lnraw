I"÷<p>I‚Äôm off to Portland State University tomorrow, to give a talk in their ‚ÄúFirst Thursday‚Äù series, at 4pm in Smith 296. If you‚Äôre in the neighborhood, please join us. If not, here are links to the slides I‚Äôll be using, including the version with notes (which help with some of the minimalist image-based slides).</p>
<p>My goal is threefold:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Introduce formal models of cultural transmission without mathematical detail or the guts of simulation models.</li>
<li>Summarize some of the ways in which formal CT models are ripe for expansion.</li>
<li>Give a short introduction to my recent researches into ‚Äúcoarse grained‚Äù models of CT, focusing on temporal aggregation and fitting CT models to time averaged data from archaeological deposits.</li>
</ol>
<p>CT models are ripe for expansion along several dimensions, and I‚Äôm going to mention and (very) briefly outline a couple:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Richer models of social learning, including embodiment of learning through artifacts and niche construction</li>
<li>Formal modeling of the structured relationship between cultural traits (i.e., getting away from the ‚Äúallele at locus models‚Äù we use at present)</li>
<li>The ability to view models at multiple temporal scales and using different classifications as observable ‚Äúfilters‚Äù</li>
</ol>
<p>Presentation slides: <a href="http://figshare.com/articles/PSU_First_Thursday_Talk_June_2013_CT_Modelling/712272">available in various formats</a></p>
