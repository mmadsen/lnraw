<p>(definition, Bailey, with some Binford etc)</p>
<p>Time perspectivism (TP) treats the archaeological record as a series of time averaged samples of artifacts, which do not necessarily share the same depositional and post-depositional histories <span class="citation" data-cites="stern2008time stein1987deposits">(Stern 2008; Stein 1987)</span>. The consequences of this kind of view are significant for the kind of synchronic, functionalist product characteristic of most archaeological research today (especially since the New Archaeology) <span class="citation" data-cites="paynter2002time">(Paynter 2002)</span>. DeBoer uses the parallel between taphonomic studies in paleontology and formation processes in archaeology to argue that there simply cannot be an isomorphism between the archaeological and systemic contexts <span class="citation" data-cites="schiffer1972archaeological deboer1983archaeological">(Schiffer 1972; DeBoer 1983)</span>. Quite simply, even without the serious epistemological issues which plague behavioral or â€œlifewaysâ€ reconstruction in archaeology, the combination of TP, geoarchaeology, and formation process studies tell us that synchronic reconstructionism is doomed to failure as a testable scientific endeavor (and hence it involved speculative interpretivism, no different than any other interpretive theory or stance in the social sciences).</p>
<p>Given Dunnellâ€™s materialist, historical metaphysic for archaeology, TP is almost the default position we should take when we consider the temporality of the archaeological record (although RCD never used the term) <span class="citation" data-cites="dunnell1980evolutionary dunnell1982harvey dunnell1992archaeology">(Dunnell 1980, 1982, 1992)</span>.</p>

<h3 id="effects-of-time-averaging">Effects of Time Averaging</h3>
<p>Most of the ways we deal with coarse-graining a time series in statistics involve taking averages over blocks of values: hence the idea of a â€œtime average.â€ <span class="citation" data-cites="delange2008time stern2008time">(De Lange 2008; Stern 2008)</span> both point out that time averaged archaeological deposits are not â€œaverages in timeâ€ of artifact deposition. Earlier, <span class="citation" data-cites="grayson1998 lyman2003influence">(Grayson and Delpech 1998; Lyman 2003)</span> made similar observations, that time averaged deposits are actually summations of materials potentially derived from a variety of different behavioral episodes and even groups of people.</p>
<p>My own work suggests that formally, time averaged samples (of artifact class abundances or frequencies) are actually the cumulative sum of depositional events, and thus represent a kind of â€œextreme valueâ€ process coarse-graining the detailed process of artifact creation, use, and deposition <span class="citation" data-cites="madsen2012ta">(Madsen 2012)</span>. But more work needs to be done to understand the different statistical effects that time averaging can have on different measures of artifact class abundance and diversity.</p>
